# Community Windows Bugs

Last resort bug tracker for Windows issues - community-driven reporting when you've tried everything else.

## Purpose

This repository is for reporting **reproducible Windows bugs only** when official Microsoft channels (Feedback Hub, support tickets, forums) haven't worked or aren't available.

## Before You Submit

1. **Ensure it's reproducible**: Can you recreate the bug consistently?

2. **Have minimal reproduction ready**: Code, files, or exact steps that demonstrate the issue quickly and easily

## How to Report

Click **Issues** → **New Issue** and fill out the required form completely.

## Acceptable

✅ Reproducible Windows bugs with clear repro steps

✅ System crashes, UI issues, API problems, performance regressions

✅ Issues that affect multiple users or have significant impact

## Not Acceptable

❌ Feature requests or enhancement suggestions

❌ General feedback or complaints

❌ Non-reproducible or vague issues

❌ Support questions ("How do I..."))

## Disclaimer

This is a **community-driven repository** with no official connection to Microsoft. Filing issues here does not guarantee they will be seen or addressed by Microsoft.
